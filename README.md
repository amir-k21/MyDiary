# MyDiary
I really need to write about my day so i decided to make this diary. and since i wanted to use sqlite i didn't want any one to be able to open the database so I encrypted my text in the software itself and also there is a window for login and password.

you can use launch4j to convert the jar to exe and then use inno to make it installable.

Preferably do not install the app in C folder of windows because it needs to read from the db and write to it constantly and the db will be in the same folder as the program so if you put it in C it's going to be a problem because windows is not gonna let it write anything to db because it's not admin.

you can change the key and user and pass in the program itself i wrote a comment for them.

I tried to show all the errors in the label on the bottom of the app so you could see if there was any problem.

if you have any question let me know.

happy writing :)
